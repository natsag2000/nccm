National Cancer Council of Mongolia is proud to be one of the first foundation partners to join the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Global Alliance, with more than 180 esteemed members from more than 68 countries around the world. This opens the door to our foundation for international networking and support, educational opportunities and the inspiration of a globally shared mission – finding cures and saving children, everywhere.

Being invited to the Alliance is an honor. Global foundation partners must be evaluated, recommended and sponsored by ALSAC (American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities), the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital awareness and fundraising organization, and must meet several criteria to apply and show evidence of their commitment to and impact on pediatric cancer outcomes in their communities.

For me, as a founder it seems like a dream to be selected and be part of this global community. I strongly believe that with all networking and expertise provided by ALSAC we will be able to reach our shared mission - finding cures and saving children, everywhere. Thank you for this opportunity”.
